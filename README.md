# World Literature Knowledge Graph

This is the repository for the World Literature Knowedge Graph, a knowledge base for the study and exploration of non-Western writers.

The resource is accessible:

* Through the SPARQL endpoint: (https://kgccc.di.unito.it/wl-kg)
* Through a web interface: (https://literaturegraph.di.unito.it/). The interface can be accessed with the following credentials: user: worldliteraturekg@gmail.com; password: demowlkg


The WL-KG, developed by the Universities of Turin and Bari, has been presented at the [NGI Search 2nd Open Call](https://ngi-search-2nd-open-call.fundingbox.com/).
